# Google Summer of Code 2017 - OpenWifi & SDWN

This is the documentation page for two projects - [SDWN for ONOS/LEDE](https://github.com/berlin-open-wireless-lab/GSoC2017_SDWN_OpenWifi/blob/master/SDWN.md) and OpenWifi. Both were realized at TU Berlin's INET department for Freifunk during Google Summer of Code 2017.
